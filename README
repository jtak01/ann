Aritificial Neural Network for IRIS flower classification.

training data set length = 120
testing data set length = 30
epoch = 15000
learning rate = 0.01
Activation function = sigmoid

Topology/architecture of network:
This ANN has 2 hidden layers. 
layer1 takes in 4 inputs and has 5 neurons
layer2 takes in 5 inputs and has 3 neurons
The potentials on the 3 neurons of layer2 determin the classification
Each neuron is completely connected with all the neurons from the previous
layer, fully-connected topology. 

Input data are normalized using the min-max method
x' = (xi - xmin) / (xmax - xmin)

Prediction accuracy: 100% with random.seed(1337)

After training the network, testing set data will be fed in and the network
will be evaluated. If user wants to test new data then just modify the
"manual_input" variable on line 253.

run with: python n_network.py
